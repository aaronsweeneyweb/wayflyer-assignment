## Notes

Start dev server: ```yarn start``` OR ```npm start```

Run tests: ```yarn test``` OR ```npm test```


I believe I am meeting all requirements, testing each of them & fairly closely matching the figma design.


The FetchButton component should be re-usable, accessible & well tested.


I made the assumption that when putting the button in a specific state via props, that it should stay in the state until clicked. 


This is my first time using Typescript so apologies if there are any glaringly poor Typescript patterns used (I am aware that I cut some corners by assigning the ```any``` type to a couple of variables).


Similarly with Styled Components. This is a first ever attempt at using them, so perhaps I've implemented the styles in some strange ways!
